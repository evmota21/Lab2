            <i class="w2">2019-Present</i> <br> 
            Trainee program at data analysis at Ragasa. Managed to establish a new practice at the continuos improvement department, where the objective was to create 
            new dashboards for several other departments like logistics, human resources and exports. All these projects were managed by me. The human resources dashboards
            was the first one to be established. Also, managed to create new key indicators for the logistics department. I worked closely for 3 weeks with the logistics director
            to establish this key indicator. Lastly, I was taken into account to develop a new department on the continous improvement department for data science.
